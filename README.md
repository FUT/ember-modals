# Ember Modals

`ember-modals` is an Ember addon that adds API-like functionality for rendering and managing modals in your Ember application. Basic stylesheets and animations are included and may be optionally imported. However, the primary purpose of this addon is to manage modal functionality whilst allowing you to focus on styling and content.


## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev ember-modals
```

And then add the modal outlet to your application template:

```
// templates/application.hbs
{{outlet 'modal'}}
```

Advanced setup instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/sir-dunxalot/ember-modals/wiki).
